# Definition of the data model which will be the foundation for the graphql CRUD API that will be generated by prisma

# Very similar to the Link version from schema.graphql
type Link {

  # @unique directive tells Prisma that you NEVER want any two Link elements in the database that have the same value for that field.
  # id: ID! is also a special field in the Prisma data model because it will auto-generate globablly unique IDs for the types that have this field.
  id: ID! @unique

  # This field is also managed by Prisma and is read-only in the API. Stores the time when the element was created. (There is also updatedAt: DateTime which stores when a Link was last updated)
  createdAt: DateTime!
  description: String!
  url: String!
}
